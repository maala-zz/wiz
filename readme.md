I used this api to fill some records in my database https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/latest.php
to run this project in your machine :
STEP 1- put it in hdocs in your php server (xampp for example) ,
STEP 2- create new database with name "ven", and then import ven.sql file to it ,
STEP 3- in your browser go to http://localhost/Ven/signin.php .. and here you go! ,
